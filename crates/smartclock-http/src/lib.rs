//! The little HTTP server the exporter and the web view share.
//!
//! Not a web framework and not trying to be: it accepts a connection,
//! hands the caller a path, and writes back a status and a body.  That
//! is the whole of what either program needs, and an async runtime and
//! a routing crate would be a large dependency for it.
//!
//! It exists as a crate rather than as two copies because the two
//! copies had already drifted -- one sent `Cache-Control`, the other
//! did not -- and because the limits below are the kind of thing that
//! gets added to one server and forgotten in the other.  The daemon's
//! own socket server learned all three of them the hard way.
